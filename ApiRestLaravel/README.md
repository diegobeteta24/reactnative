## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Running the dev server on 0.0.0.0 (LAN) and custom port

If you want to expose the Laravel dev server to your local network (for mobile device or emulator testing), run the built-in server binding to 0.0.0.0 and a custom port. From the project root (PowerShell):

```powershell
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Notes:
- Update `APP_URL` in your `.env` if you need generated URLs to match the host/port, for example `APP_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000` (or better, use your machine IP: `http://192.168.x.y:8000`).
- Ensure Windows Firewall allows incoming connections to the chosen port, or use a tunnel (ngrok) if you prefer not to open ports.
- To serve uploaded files via `Storage::url()`, run `php artisan storage:link` once in your environment (this project already runs that when requested).
- From a mobile device or emulator, use your machine's LAN IP (not `localhost`) when connecting to the API.

If you want this to be a one-liner in PowerShell you can run (from project root):

```powershell
php artisan storage:link; php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```
